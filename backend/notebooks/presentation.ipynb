    "# How to create an index in Django\n",

    "You can also set a list of `indexes` inside a model `Meta` class and define which field(s) each index will use, as in the example below. More on the different types of indexes later.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyModel(models.Model):\n",
    "    foo = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n",
